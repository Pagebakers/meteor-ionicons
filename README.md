meteor-ionicons
===================

Meteor package for Ionicons.

# Ionicons

The premium icon font for [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/). Designed by [@helloimben](https://twitter.com/helloimben).

Visit [ionicons.com](http://ionicons.com) and  check out the search feature, which has keywords identifying common icon names and styles. For example, if you search for “arrow” we call up every icon that could possibly be used as an arrow. We’ve also included each icon’s class name for easy copy/pasting when you’re developing!

We intend for this icon pack to be used with [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/), but it’s by no means limited to it. Use them wherever you see fit, personal or commercial. They are free to use and licensed under [MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).


## Getting Started

```bash
meteor add pagebakers:ionicons
```


## HTML Example

You can use [ionicons.com](http://ionicons.com) to easily find the icon you want to use. Once you've copied the desired icon's CSS classname, simply add the icon's classname to an HTML element.

```html
<i class="ion-home"></i>
```
